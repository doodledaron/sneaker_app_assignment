How to set up? 
Pre-requisite:
- Installed latest python (stable version)
- Installed SSMS

Setting up the Django project:
1. In the project folder, open the terminal then type 'pipenv shell' to activate the Python virtual environment. (ENSURE the virtual environment is always activated before running the server)
2. To install the required packages, type 'pipenv install -r requirements.txt'
3. Now Ensure that in the settings.py, the databases variable is set as follows:
   DATABASES = {
    'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'mssql',
            'NAME': 'yourdatabasename',
            'USER': 'yourssmsusername',
            'PASSWORD': 'yourpassword',
            'HOST': 'MYSERVER\SQLEXPRESS',
            'PORT': '',
            'OPTIONS': {
                'driver': 'ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server',}, 
}
}
4. Now, to connect Django with SSMS, type 'python manage.py makemigrations' then 'python manage.py migrate'. This will connect Django with SSMS. If there are no errors means your Django has connected to SSMS successfully.
5. Log in to SSMS, and restore the database named test.bak file.
6. Now, run the Django server by typing 'python manage.py runserver'. A link '127.0.0.1' will be shown in the terminal, Ctrl + left click the link to access the link. Now the customer interface is accessed.

1. Once the database is restored, go to the endpoint '/admin'. ('127.0.0.1'/admin/) and enter the credentials:
